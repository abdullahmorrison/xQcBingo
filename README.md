# xQc Bingo
This is a game where twitch viewers that watch twitch.tv/xQcOW can play Bingo.

### Current Goal:
- [ ] Code the design made on adobe xd (in design folder)
- [ ] Deploy the website

### Future Possiblities:
- Add Twitch Login (I have difficulty integrating oauth into my code. Need help with it)
- Add a leaderboard
- Add a database which will allow the following:
  - Users can create boards and upload them so that other viewers can play their board
  - Multiple users can play on the same board
    - Moderators can run a huge Bingo game where the winner can win a prize (ex: gifted sub)
